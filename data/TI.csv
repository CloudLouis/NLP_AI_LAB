The International, often abbreviated as TI, is an annual tournament organized by Valve. In 2015 Valve increased their number of hosted events, founding the Dota Major Championships which incorporates The International into its structure.The International remains the biggest and most prestigious event on the Major Championship circuit.The first International was held in Cologne, Germany, during the trade show Gamescom, in order to unveil Dota 2 to worldwide audiences. It drew attention due to its staggering $1.6 million USD prize pool (with $1 million for the champion). 16 teams were invited to play for the title.In 2012 The International moved to Seattle, Washington. The prize pool remained at $1.6 million USD. Only 14 teams were invited. Two additional slots were awarded to the winners of regional qualifiers. Since 2013, the Dota 2 community has been able to contribute to the prize pool. The total prize of The International 2013 grew to $2.8 million USD. In 2014, the prize pool surpassed $10 million. In 2016 it eclipsed $20 million, making The International the biggest esports tournament in terms of prize pool.|Gaming
MDL Changsha kicks off tomorrow with the Group Stages and after a rather entertaining draw, the groups are now in place and the teams are ready to get the first of three Dota 2 Majors which close out the DPC season underway. Tomorrow our journey towards The International 2018 continues as the MDL Changsha Dota 2 Major kicks off in China. The Major is the first of three which will close out the inaugural season of the Dota Pro Circuit and features 12 teams from around the world competing for the sizeable prize pool, but more importantly, the 1500 DPC points on offer. The team managers and captains got together a few hours ago and the draw for the Group Stages took place. The format of the draw was decided beforehand, placing the 2 highest ranked DPC teams involved in separate groups (PSG.LGD and Team Secret) before these 2 teams picked their opponents in alternating fashion, with Secret picking first. The Group Stages will feature a best-of-two round robin where the winners of each group will go straight through into the 2nd round of the Upper bracket, 2nd and 3rd place will advance to the first round of the Upper bracket, 4th and 5th place will move to the Lower bracket while the last place in each group will be eliminated. Once teams are in the Upper bracket playoffs, all games up to the grand final will be best-of-three, while the Lower bracket opens up with a best-of-one before moving into best-of-three's all the way up until the grand final.|Gaming
The Dota 2 Battle Pass's custom game modes are sounding a little more goofy this year. The first one to be released by Valve is just like any game of Dota 2, except with 24-hour rotating modifiers thrown in to spice it up. In other words, if Dota 2 didn't have enough bogus abilities, wait until you see what this mode introduces. So far, the game mode has brought in some pretty hilarious modifiers. If you thought runes were already strong, wait until you see an enemy coming at you with a quadruple-powered Haste Rune. There's nothing quite like a few Ancient creeps stomping down the lane, regardless of which side of the Ancient you're on. And sometimes, a simple teammate resurrection is juicy enough.|Gaming
With the new login theme now added to the game's PBE, players can expect to see it come to the game's live servers sometime soon. It'll replace the current login theme for MSI 2018 when it does, the season's first international event that's currently underway. There's also no release date that's been set yet for the Clash tournament mode that Riot Games has been testing over time with PBE trial runs and live betas. One of the most recent betas for the Clash mode was launched back in April where even non-PBE players could test the new mode by forming teams and fighting for prizes. The PBE tests that have been held in the past were Riot's way of trying to squash some bugs while incentivizing players with rewards if they helped contribute to the tests while the open beta allowed more players to participate than ever before where a first look at the system was provided. To participate in the feature when it goes live for everyone, you'll have to first put together a worthy team and then purchase some entry tickets to compete. These tickets can be bought with either Blue Essence or Riot Points and everyone on the team will have to be a ticket-holder to obtain entry.|Gaming

"The video appears to show our new person-shaped champion falling into the maw of a giant undersea monster before transforming into something truly terrifying. Now, Pyke appears to stalk the streets looking for victims to string up for gruesome fish-based murder seeking revenge on the crew mates that let him drown. Accompanying the video in the original Tweet was the message, ""Pyke's shipmates watched him drown. In his eyes, all of Bilgewater is guilty."" The video also has some narration where Pyke has the chance to tell his own grim story, ""I remember the day I died, and those who betrayed me. Yes, I see them. I see the faces of all who were. You, you look familiar."" According to Riot's initial tease, Pyke is likely to be a support with plenty of play-making potential. He is also supposed to have a ""deep darker thematic than most of the support cast,"" which seems to be an understatement based on this video. This early teaser likely means we are going to see more of Pyke soon, when we can hopefully learn exactly what this new support can do".|Gaming
At the end of last year the ECS Counter-Strike: Global Offensive league, which has an annual prize pool of $1.5 million, did something a little different. Instead of hiring a massive arena and putting on a big stage show for the finals of their league, as the team had done for each of the three previous seasons, they decided to book out a ton of rooms at the Hard Rock Hotel in Cancun, Mexico and let the team compete for hundreds of thousands of dollars while enjoying a stay at a luxury resort. Many questioned the decision, sure some smaller events had tried similar things, but nothing on this kind of scale. It also meant that there was no live crowd for the matches, which could reduce the excitement, and the relaxed atmosphere could mean that some teams were not in the right mindset. However, it turned out pretty well, with many saying it was the perfect end to the year of pro CS, and unsurprising all the players loved it.|Gaming
The FACEIT London Major is set to be the first Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major held in the UK, and it has a pretty fitting location of Wembley arena. But the Minors, which will decide which teams will make it to the Major, will head to another of London's iconic sporting locations, Twickenham Stadium. The stadium which is best known as the home of English rugby, will host all of the regional Minors for the FACEIT Major, which is a change to what we usually see. Most Majors have held each Minor in its own region, but FACEIT have decided to bring everyone to London to battle it out. It's a risky move as visa issues could get in the way more than usual, but if it works then it will surely present a much better Minor system than previous years.|Gaming
The online section of ECS Season 5 came to an end on May 12th in both North America and Europe. Eight teams qualified for the LAN finals that are set to take to take place from June 8th to June 10th in Wembley. Out of the eight qualified teams, North America and Europe each have four teams representing the regions. The European teams consist of Astralis, Fnatic, G2 Esports and FaZe Clan. Astralis looks to be the favorite heading in the ECS Season 5 Finals, as the veteran laddened squad only lost one map out of 18 played during the online ECS season. North America's four representatives will be Cloud9, NRG Esports, Team Liquid and Luminosity Gaming. NRG Esports lead the way in the North American standings with a superb online ECS season, while a three way tie saw Team Liquid and Luminosity Gaming may their way in over Renegades and ECS Season 3 Champions SK Gaming.|Gaming
The Bounty Rune saw some pretty heavy changes this week. Bounty Rune spawns have slowed down from every 2 minutes to every 5 minutes, but everyone gets a slice. In addition, it fills empty bottles the same way any other rune would. So now it's a pretty valuable pick-up, and there are certainly going to be fights over it in your upcoming matches. Roshan is a little bit stronger now, with damage, HP regeneration and base health kicking up. We've seen some pretty fast Roshan wipes competitively, and this should bring the pace down and make entering the Rosh Pit a little more drastic of a choice. Denying a Tower entirely removes the bounty for the offensive team. Before it was a small sum per player, but now there's more motivation to ensure the other team doesn't pick up the full bounty. Captain's Mode saw its first changes since The International this past year. For one, each round has an extra five seconds tacked on, bringing the timer up from 30 to 35 seconds per pick. They've also flipped the order of the second ban, from 2nd/1st/2nd/1st to 1st/2nd/1st/2nd. In addition, there are changes to the lane creeps, Observer Wards and the map itself, so be sure to read up below if you plan on playing yourself or following the competitive scene! It's not a huge patch length-wise, but its impact will instantly be felt.|Gaming
"Following in the footsteps of Fortnite and PUBG, Dota 2 is introducing The Underhollow, which is another version of an underground battle royale. Billed as ""a multi-team dungeon clash,"" that involves going on a quest for cheese, it's only available to 2018 International Battle Pass subscribers. ""Battle through a labyrinth filled with monsters, marvels, and many other three-player enemy squads as you search for Roshan's rarest cheese and work to be the last team standing,"" the website says. ""You'll need to navigate carefully to earn the XP and Gold needed to destroy your opponents."" But there's more: The labyrinth you're in appears to be unstable and there will be cave-ins along the way, limiting the field of play. As PC Gamer points out, this isn't an exact description of a battle royale, but there certainly are a lot of similarities. It makes sense" these types of games are incredibly popular right now, so why wouldn't others want to jump on the bandwagon and ride it out? We'll likely get more details about The Underhollow, including an available date, soon.|Gaming
There's no tournament like The International, held each year to challenge players dedicated to the complexity of Dota 2. Between the passion of the fans, the history and depth of Dota 2 and the event's prize pool over $24.8 last year, thanks to crowd-funding it's become a spectacle of its own right within the competitive video gaming scene. Started in 2011 as an event within Gamescom with a $1 million first-place prize, it grew into its own monster of a tournament over the years into the mega-event it is now. The International moved in its second year from Germany to a concert hall in Seattle and, eventually, into the Key Arena. However, this year, it'll take place in Rogers Arena in Vancouver, but the excitement will certainly cross the border with the event.|Gaming
The upcoming adidas Dragon Ball Z collaboration has been one of the most talked about releases of the year thus far, and we haven't even gotten a look at the actual shoes yet until now. Son Goku, the chief protagonist of the Dragon Ball Z series, will be represented by an all-new silhouette called the adidas ZX500 RM. This model is a modifed version of the ZX500 as it features a full-length BOOST cushioning midsole and a heel apex that reaches higher than the original. This is said to be sample of the Goku adidas shoe, but this is clearly the best look yet thus far. Stay tuned for more updates on the adidas Dragonball collection and expect a release in August.|Fashion

Jordan Brand is ready to start 2018 with a bang as the long-awaited sequel to the 2007 collaboration with Levi's is set to release on January 17th. The Air Jordan 4, draped completely in denim, takes on some of the Levi's brand DNA by way of custom leather patches on the tongue, leather labels on the inner tongues, contrast stitching in golden yellow, and the signature red-tab branding that emulates a classic pair of jeans. A stylish contrast is achieved by reversing the denim fabric on the tongue, side panel, and interior lining, while a white/gum outsole combination adds to the blue-collar appeal. The shoes will release worldwide at select retailers, with select stores releasing the accompanying Trucker Jacket in limited quantity. See the official store list ahead and don't forget to enter as many raffles as you can, because copping a pair won't be easy. This collaboration has release and sold out, if you need a pair, check out Stadium Goods or eBay.|Fashion
Premier Italian retail destination Slam Jam Socialism is teaming up with NEIGHBORHOOD to release its latest capsule collection. The duo's second collaborative effort, following up from their 2009 "Bianco Bianco" capsule, pays tribute to '80s underground subcultures that both imprints have previously drawn from. The spray painted details and heavy distressing, which are featured on the button-up shirts and hard-washed denim, perhaps embody the rebellious spirit the best. The collaboration is balanced out with more polished constructions as seen on the co-branded coach jacket and souvenir jacket. Additional items include a selection of T-shirts and a new exclusive colorway of the hand-crafted Booze Reaper incense chamber.

The Met Gala is one of New York's most fashionable events of the year and this 2018's theme is "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination." Last year's theme was based on iconic designer Rei Kawakubo and her label Commes des Garcons. With the opening comes a lot of expectations from watchers who will want to see A-list stars as well as notable fashion industry names in their best outfits. One of those big industry names is designer Virgil Abloh who was just appointed as men's design lead at Louis Vuitton. With that said, fans and industry experts alike have a lot of expectations from the Off-White founder in regards to his involvement with LV. While the public hasn't really seen anything yet from Abloh for Vuitton, it looks like the 38-year-old creative has just teased of things to come on his Instagram. For one, the pieces he's previewing are in fact items coming from LV's men's atelier which will have a runway show this June, according to Abloh. The pieces are part of a suit and include a vest, tee and pouch as seen in the video. "Louis Vuitton atelier homme 2 eme etage pont neuf - fait main 03 mai 18" is also embroidered on the inside of the vest.

UK-based Fashion Revolution has just released the third edition of its Fashion Transparency Index, which ranks brands according to how much they disclose about their practices. Brands are ranked by a point system which looks at how open they are about their supply chain, worker conditions and environmental impact, and how the brand responds to trade unions and gender issues. Among the brands and labels to come out on top, meaning the most transparent labels, adidas, Reebok, PUMA and H&M scored high, falling between 51 to 60 percent transparency. The aforementioned brands are then followed closely behind by Levi's, Vans, The North Face, Timberland, and Zara with a 41 to 50 percent transparency. On the other hand, high-end luxury brands such as Chanel, Versace, Dior, Marc Jacobs and Dolce & Gabbana were ranked the lowest, scoring less than 10 percent transparency, alongside Sports Direct and Urban Outfitters. Fashion Revolution was set up five years ago in response to the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh, where 1,138 garment workers died and more than 2,000 were injured. Fashion Revolution aims to stress the importance of brand transparency, hoping to prevent human rights and environmental abuse in factories. As brands become more transparent, Fashion Revolution will allow customers to make empowered decisions on where, or where not to, shop. The report included 150 labels across the luxury, accessories, sport, and high-street sectors with an annual turnover of more than $500 million USD.|Fashion
"Valtteri Bottas set a new testing lap record for the Circuit de Catalunya as Mercedes ended the first in-season test on top of the timesheets in Barcelona. Bottas posted a 1:16.904 on supersoft tyres in the morning session,lowering the previous record of 1:17.182 which Sebastian Vettel had set in pre-season testing. The Finn also racked up 139 laps more than double a Spanish GP race distance as he finished 0.068s ahead of Antonio Giovinazzi's Ferrari,the Italian completing the most laps with 148. Bottas' time was over six tenths quicker than the leading time Max Verstappen had set in the Red Bull on day one,""but still well down on Lewis Hamilton's pole lap of 1:16.1 at the weekend's grand prix. """"Today was really interesting and we got through our programme fairly smoothly"", said Bottas. We had a good baseline from last weekend and used it to work on different set-ups,""trying out bigger changes than we normally would on a race weekend. """"We also tried to gather some information on the tyres"",as we will see similarly smooth tarmac at Silverstone and Paul Ricard." British teenager Lando Norris recorded the third-fastest time of the day late on with a 1:18.039 as McLaren recovered from an on-track stoppage in the afternoon. The Formula 2 championship leader's effort on soft tyres was nine tenths faster than Stoffel Vandoorne's best time on supersofts on Tuesday,""although fuel levels and car settings are unknown. """"Today wasn't about testing while doing flat-out qualifying or race-spec driving as such"",it was more about aero tests, said Norris. It was also all about keeping it on the track,which I didn't quite do a little spin into the entry of Turn 12,""but nothing major to be consistent and complete the tests for the team.""""It's good that I can show the team what I can do"",but I see it more as an opportunity for me to keep learning and developing,and learn from both Stoffel and Fernando over race weekends,rather than proving that I can do a lap-time." Norris' effort relegated Kevin Magnussen's Haas to fourth,while Force India's Nikita Mazepin ended fifth with a 1:18.344 lap in the final hour of the day. British-Korean Jack Aitken had an encouraging debut in the Renault,completing 120 laps and ending sixth in the timesheet,just ahead of Suaber race driver Charles Leclerc. Fresh from making his Grand Prix weekend return,Robert Kubica was back in the Williams FW41 and completed 123 laps,but the Pole was 2.3 seconds off Bottas' leading pace and down in eighth. Pierre Gasly took over the Toro Rosso in the afternoon session from Sean Gelael and was ninth with a 1:19.410 effort on medium tyres,Gelael ending his running in 12th. On his Red Bull debut,Jake Dennis was 10th after setting a best time of 1:20.440 in the final 90 minutes,""the 22-year-old Briton managing 75 laps in total. """"Obviously it's a big step up from what I'm used to in GT racing but I got used to the speed and the grip quite quickly and we managed to get through the whole run plan in the end"", he said. It was nice to change a few things to give me a proper representation of the difference between the simulator and real life. So we have a few things to work on back in Milton Keynes to help Max and Daniel Ricciardo and make it even more realistic for them. But overall,super happy,a big thanks to the team for giving me the opportunity,and hopefully I'll be back in the RB14 soon!" With McLaren and Force India running two cars as they also conducted a Pirelli tyre test,Vandoorne was 10th fastest in the MCL33,while Nicholas Latifi was slowest of all as he carried out the role in the VJM11. The final two days of in-season testing takes place at the Hungaroring following the Hungarian GP in late July and immediately before F1's summer break."|Sports
When Lewis Hamilton pulled out of the garage on Tuesday,he did so in a Mercedes that sported a rear wing featuring two vertical red lights in the endplates. It has emerged the FIA asked the team to run the new lights,which are in addition to the central rear light the cars already have,as they look to improve visibility for following drivers in wet conditions. Article 22.12 of the sporting regulations currently states that the car’s rear light must be illuminated at all times when it is running on intermediate or wet-weather tyres. While the warm and sunny conditions at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on Tuesday weren’t ideal for testing the device,information on its functionality could still be gathered. Should the FIA decide to push on with additional lights,they would not be introduced until next season at the earliest.|Sports
"After the Chinese Grand Prix,F1’s governing body told teams they could mount mirrors on the halo to allow for better visibility and Ferrari became the first team to do so in Spain. But rival teams were unhappy. There was a belief that the winglets Ferrari used in conjunction with the mirrors were being used primarily for aerodynamic rather than visibility reasons,which is against the rules. The FIA took a closer look and will move to clarify the situation by sending out a technical directive ahead of the upcoming Monaco Grand Prix. "It's a liberal interpretation of the word 'mounting'," said Whiting. "That's how they become legal,because there is no bodywork allowed in the area in the upper part of that. "The interpretation hinges on whether we think that's a mounting or not. We somehow think not so we’re going to take some action on that. "They Ferrari think it the winglet contributes to the rigidity of the mirror. It's just a matter of interpretation and such a tenuous interpretation is not something we're happy with." Whiting said Ferrari were allowed to keep the device on for the remainder of the weekend "because it is a reasonable way of approaching things and it is something we’ve done many times when there is a difference of opinion". However when asked if the device is effectively banned,Whiting said: "Yes,you could say that. If it was a clear breach of the regulations,""they wouldn’t have been allowed to use it in Barcelona. But we’ll clarify that to everybody. """"No I don’t expect to see it in Monaco. If we do we're probably going to see the stewards about it. The technical directive will make it clear." Whiting said he was not qualified to say whether the device offered an aerodynamic advantage but added: "I doubt they would be there if there wasn't a measurable aero advantage"",but these days that doesn't have to be big.""|Sports
The Ferrari driver made a brilliant getaway,picking up a tow off Valtteri Bottas before catapulting past into Turn 1 to run second behind race leader Lewis Hamilton. He was on course to finish in P2 before Ferrari pitted him for a second time – while his immediate rivals all made a one-stop strategy work – and that dropped him to fourth. Vettel explained that Ferrari had little option than to pit again,as the Prancing Horse simply could not use the tyres as efficiently as Mercedes and Red Bull. "We couldn’t make the tyres last so for us," said Vettel. "It was clear we had to come in again. I think it was the right thing to do. "If you look from outside it’s easier,but inside the car,we were going through the tyres too quick. Therefore we were not able to stay out for another 23 laps. Even in the end,with a fresher set,I wasn’t able to attack until the end." Ferrari have had the best car so far this year,but Spain marked a turning point with Mercedes dominating throughout the weekend. Vettel put their drop in form down to three things: speed,tyres – referring to the change in tread depth for this specific race – and reliability. "First,we were not quick enough," said Vettel. "If we’re not able to see that,we’re more than blind because we didn’t have the pace in the first stint. "Second,I think we struggled a bit over the course of the weekend with the tyres. They changed but they changed for everyone. Our ambition needs to be that we’re better off rather than worse off. "Third,I think it was a poor weekend in terms of reliability. Kimi Raikkonen had an issue with the engine on Friday,had to change the engine and obviously then retired in the race. "I don’t know what happened. Overall,there are three things we must be able to see. If we don’t see those,there are no excuses. "I’ve said many times this team is strong and we have a lot of potential,but we also need to make sure we address the problems that we have and work together in the same direction. "The season so far has been positive for us. Today was not a good day but it’s important to understand why. "You look back and you understand what is missing in the preparation to the race,or this race,or the next races." Ferrari surrendered the lead in the constructors’ championship to Mercedes and now trail them by 27 points after five races. Vettel,meanwhile,lost ground to Hamilton and is now 17 points adrift.|Sports
"Grosjean who embarrassingly crashed out of the previous race in Azerbaijan after losing control behind the Safety Car lost control of his Haas around Turn 3,spinning across the track in a huge fog of smoke before taking out the unfortunate pair of Hulkenberg and Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly. The DNF capped off a disappointing weekend for Hulkenberg – who failed to reach Q2 on Saturday for the first time since the 2015 Spanish GP – and the Renault driver was less than pleased with the role Grosjean had played. "I got crashed into,Romain spun,came back into the track and I couldn't go anywhere," he told the BBC. "I couldn't avoid him and he took the back end of my car,""there was nothing I could do. """"He (Grosjean) didn't look great in that scenario"",generally he likes spinning,but the first lap is not a good time to do it with everyone there. He has to look at it and do some work on himself." It was a chaotic start to the fifth race of what has been a thrilling season so far – and the incident left Hulkenberg frustrated. "It was quite messy Turn 1,2,cars all over the place and then in Turn 3 I didn't see so much because my vision was blocked with other cars,then last second I saw smoke coming up and saw a car rolling coming towards me. "I tried to avoid on the right but he was coming at me with too much speed and took the whole rear left corner off and that was the end of that. "I've seen a replay on the way back,there's not much I can do in that situation,Romain he spins on his own,he's doing the ballet dancer and wipes two out so it's very frustrating." The incident was triggered after Grosjean’s team mate Kevin Magnussen,immediately ahead on the road,momentarily struggled for grip,unsettling the Frenchman who later told stewards he had kept his foot down as he began to spin,as he had felt it was his best chance of moving out of the path of other cars. "I lost the rear end,and at one point I thought the car would come back to me and it did not so I spun," said Grosjean. "I tried to put it back straight as soon as I could to avoid an incident but it didn't work." When asked if it was the correct move to keep his foot on the power,he replied: "I think it's the natural thing to do. If you look at Nico Rosberg with Sebastian Vettel in Malaysia in 2016 that's what he did,and Michael Schumacher in 2010 Abu Dhabi. It's just the fastest way of bringing the car back in the right direction,you don't want to face the others. "Kevin had a little wobble,I lift off to avoid any contact,as the first thing you don't want is to hit your team mate,and I lost it. It came back a little bit but that's why I went on the power. I don't know if I touched the astroturf or whatever and it spun again. If I brake,or if I'd stayed on throttle,I think it would have changed nothing." The early exits means Grosjean remains 19th in the drivers’ standings and has now gone nine races without scoring a point. Hulkenberg meanwhile drops to eighth with 22 and Gasly remains P12 on 12."|Sports
There has been a lot of talk in recent weeks in regard to what machinery certain teams will be running next year,however,two teams look to have finalised a deal for 2019.

At the Spanish GP,a Ducati spokesman told Crash.net,"the only thing that we can say is that there is a 99% chance that we will continue with both Avintia and Aspar/Angel Nieto for 2019." This means the Italian factory look set to field eight bikes on the MotoGP™ grid,spanning across four teams,for the fourth consecutive year. Borsoi did confirm he’d spoken to Yamaha about their vacant M1’s,after it was confirmed Tech 3 would use KTM machines from 2019. He also confirmed they had spoken with Suzuki,however Borsoi sees no reason why the Angel Nieto Team should leave Ducati. "The target is to close a deal with Ducati. At the moment there is no sense to change manufacturers. We spoke to Ducati this weekend. After,we agreed to continue working with them because there is a good balance between them and us."|Sports
After a dramatic round at the Circuito de Jerez,the MotoGP paddock heads to Le Mans for the HJC Helmets Grand Prix de France,but who will be victorious on French soil? Marc Marquez (Repsol Honda Team) comes to Le Mans off the back of two consecutive victories,and leads the World Championship for the first time this season. However,the French circuit is a track he hasn’t had a podium at since winning in 2014,including a DNF and a 13th place finish in the previous two years.The venue has been a tricky one for Honda in general recently,with Yamaha taking the last three victories at the circuit. However,before Marquez,Dani Pedrosa (Repsol Honda Team) did win at a rain soaked Le Mans in 2013,and MotoGP Legend Casey Stoner crossed the line first in 2011. Can the Japanese factory get back to winning ways in France this weekend? The Movistar Yamaha MotoGP duo of Maverick Vinales and Valentino Rossi will certainly try and have a say in that. The pair had a tougher than expected round in Andalusia,but aforementioned,they come to a circuit that has suited the M1 in the past. Last season,both Vinales and Rossi along with home hero Johann Zarco (Monster Yamaha Tech 3) dominated the race. The Spaniard eventually took victory after a fantastic battle with his teammate,with Rossi crashing at Turn 11 on the final lap. The factory garage will be hoping for more of the same this year,minus the crash. Before his switch from the M1 to Ducati,Le Mans was Jorge Lorenzo’s (Ducati Team) playground. The five-time World Champion is the rider with the most Grand Prix victories at Le Mans,having stood on the top step of the podium on six separate occasions,five times in the premier class.The Spaniard has won both in the wet,and in the dry at Le Mans,both by impressive margins. In 2009,Lorenzo judged it to perfection for a 17 second victory margin in mixed conditions,then in 2016,he was victorious by over 10 seconds. In Jerez this season,the number 99 looked to have rediscovered his mojo,leading comfortably in the opening stages. Will the 31-year-old carry this positive form over and battle for the podium on board his GP18 this weekend? Podiums are something Team Suzuki Ecstar have been enjoying recently. Their three consecutive third-place finishes were the first time they’ve managed that since Sachsenring,Laguna Seca and Brno in 2008,with Chris Vermeulen and Loris Capirossi. Is a fourth on the cards in Le Mans? Suzuki have had five wins at Bugatti circuit in the premier class,the last of which was in 2007 with Vermeulen. Vinales also finished third at Le Mans in 2016,which was the first podium for Suzuki since Loris Capirossi was third at Brno in 2008. The Hamamatsu factory will be confident they can challenge for a podium again this weekend.|Sports
LCR Honda Castrol rider Cal Crutchlow has given high praise to the newly surfaced Silverstone circuit,explaining the new asphalt may lead to lap times being "1.5 seconds quicker" when the MotoGP paddock heads to British shores at the end of August. The 2018 Argentina GP winner was at the Northamptonshire circuit on board a Honda RC213V-S,the road going version of his race winning prototype machine,and gave very positive feedback on the work that was done over winter at Silverstone. "It’s been a privilege to be at Silverstone today and to see the work and investment that has gone into the improvements to the track," said an up-beat Crutchlow. Before the resurfacing,the riders complained that the surface was too inconsistent,with plenty of bumps. Now though,Crutchlow expects to see lap records tumble. "The consistency is incredible and that’s definitely going to have an impact on lap records. If I was to take a guess at the impact on lap times,I would think it’s going to be about 1.5 seconds a lap faster than before and that’s a massive amount of time to save each lap at MotoGP level."|Sports
